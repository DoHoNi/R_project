#1 how many pull requests are available in the data for analysis? = 131191

#2 how many pull requests are submitted from each country?
There is 123 country where have nationalities of submitters.
summary count_pr -> min : 1.0/ 1st Qu : 8.0 / midian : 52.5 / Mean 1058 / 3rd Qu 448 / Max : 55633
The country that has the most submitted pull requsets is United states.The United states has 55633 pull request
The number of countries that has one submitted pull request are 12

#3 How many pull requests are submitted to each project?
There is 999 projects.


#4 how many pull requests are reviewed by each developers?
This result is really strange.
Min = 1.00 / 1st Qu. = 1.00 / Median = 2.00/ Mean = 26.57 / 3rd Qu.=8.00 / Max = 39216.00
The interesting thing about this result is that 3047 reviewers out of 6419 reviewers have reviewed just once. 
The number of reviewers who reviewed pull requests up to 0.1% of total is 242.

#How many people who prs and prm are the same person and prs and prc are the same person are?
all pr = 131191 / prs=prm : 31386 / prs=prc : 48321 / prs=prc and merged :31673 / prs=prc and closed :16648
It mean prs=prm : 23.92% prs_prc : 36.83% -> merged :24.14 (65.55) , closed :12.69(34.45) 

#5 what is thae start and end dataes of activities in the dataset?
I had difficulty getting the first and last time of pull requests in the whole, so I serched differently according to each situation.
crated_at = 2010-08-31 12:19:21 / 2014-02-07 20:58:13
merged_at = 2011-03-17 06:26:10 / 2014-02-08 00:35:41
closed_at = 2011-03-17 04:14:05 / 2014-02-08 07:55:53
the first pull request  => create 2010-08-31 12:19:21
the last pull request  => close 2014-02-08 07:55:53

#6 what is the overall pull requset acceptance rate for the sample of data? = 70%

#7 How many pull requests are submitted per country? => The result is same as #2 question.

#8 How many pull requests are evaluated per country?
The most evaluated country is the United States (64641)
The second most evaluated country is the United kingdom(14776)
The smallest number is 1, and 16 countries are evaluated once.

The total number of countries is 105.
min :1 / 1st qu :4 / midian : 38 / mean :1248 / 3rd Qu. : 487 / max : 64641

# What country has the largest number of diffrence between submission and evaluating?
I built this expression. the number of submission - the number of evaluation = ?
The country with the largest positive difference is India.(1806)
The country with the second largest positive difference is Japan(1469)
The country with the largest negative difference is the United states (-9008)
The dountry with the second largest negative difffeence is poland(-1154)

The number of countries where the difference is positive is 84.
The number or countries where the difference is negative is 18.
The number of countries whrer the difference is 0 is 3.

There are a lot of countries that generally submit more than evaluation.

#9 #10 What is the pull request acceptance rate when the pull requests are divide based on the country of submitter?
summary merge_rate >> min :0 / 1st Qu : 46 / median :60 / mean : 56 / 3rd qu :71 / max :100
There are 6 countries that has 100% accept rate, and 13 countries that has 0% accept rate.

# why some country has 100% accept rate?
the country having 100% accept rate : Armenia(13) , Cuba(1), Cyprus(1),Martinique(1),Qatar(1),Rwanda(1)
the result -> 
Armenia : there is one developer, his all pull request marged by himself. 
Cuba : There is just one pull requset , but his pull requset is marged by American(8592).
Cyprus : There is just one pull requset, but his pull request is merged by Argentina(6616).
Martinique : There is just one pull request, but his pull requst is merged by Russia(4942).
Qatar : There is just one pull requst, but his pull request is merged by Italy(55945).
Rwanda : There is just one pull requset, but his pull requset is merged by American(71897).
	= The result show the reason for that question is that all of pull request from Armenia is merged by himself, there is only one pull requst from the rest of the country.


#why some country has 0% integration rate?
The number of countries where has 0% accept rate is closed is 13.
11 countries have fewer then 6 pull request, of which seven countries have one pull requset.
Virgin islands and Tunisia each have 12 and 13 pull request.
Virgin islands has only one develper.
6 out of the 13 his pull requsets were closed by the requesting himself.
One of them was closed by integrator from the United States who has 38.82% integration rate. [cnt_pr = 85]
Another was closed by integrator from the Australia who has 14.08% integration rate.[cnt_pr = 142]
The others was closed by integrator from the Australia who has 7.01% integration rate.[cnt_pr = 827] 
Tunisia has 4 developers.
What is interesting here is that all pull requests were closed by a Vietnamese, except for the pull	requests that was closed by themselves.
4 developers of Tunisia sent pull requests at same group 'exoplatform' even though the project names were differnt like exoplatfrom/platform , exoplatform/ecms.
The Vietnamese has 12.9 integration rate [cnt_pr = 93]

I try to find other factors like size of project, how many files have changed, but I didn't find any particular pattern. 
but, Integrtion rate of 0% mean no one has ever been merged. 
And the numbers 12 and 13 might be seem to be relatively high compared to countries with 0% integration rate, but it is not large in the overall data.
One of the factors I can guess is that they were inexperience submitter, and the countries was a unfamiliar country to integrator.

#11 How many projects are analyzed? = There is 999 projects.

#12 How many pull requsets are analyzed per projects? = The result is same as #2 

#13 How many developers work for each project?
The project name with the most developers is 'rails' (6137)
The number of projects with the fewest developers is 24, The number of developer at project with the fewest developer is 1.
min :1 / 1st Qu : 24.5 / median :71 / mean : 131.3 / 3rd Qu : 129.5 / Max :6137 

The number of projects with fewer than 10 developers is 148. 
This number is about 15% at total number of projects, since the total number of projects is 999.

# how many people are the same person with submitter and merger and submitter and closer from country?
The United States,which has the highest number of requests, is 20 percent of its that had merged own self and 40% of its that had closed own self. 
Armenia has 100% merge rate, but all sumitters and mergers is same.
51 countries have 0% of rate that sumbitter and the merger is same out of entire pull requset.
Chile,which has the secound highest rate of merge (93%), has 83% of pull requests that submitters and mergers are same.
Even though Azerbaijan has 84% merge rate and 75 pull requests, but the rate of cases where submitter and merger are same is only 1.33%
Croatia is also has 68 pull requests and 82.35% merge rate, but the rate of cases wherer submitter and merger are same is only 0%!
Generally, when there are many cases where the submitter and the merger are the same, there are many cases where the submitter and the closer are the same. Because if it is merged, the closer is merger.
But Vietnam has 5% of rate that submitters and mergers are same, even though 57.94% of rate that submitters and closer are same.
South Africa has 1378 pull requests and 91% merge rate, but rate of what the submitter and the merger are the same is 54.57%
Poland has 843 pull request and the rate of what submitter and the merger is 3.32%

#14 What is the pull request acceptance rate per project? 
summary(repo_merge_rate)
min:0 / 1st qu :43.95 / median :75.38 / Mean : 63.83 / 3rd Qu : 90.12 / Max :100
There is 56 projects that has 100% merge rate and 103 projects that has 0% merge rate.
There is 26 projects that has 0% merge rate and more then 30 pull requests.
There is 10 projects that has 0% merge rate and more then 100 pull requests!!

I would like to find the reason why they have 0% marge rate. 
So I made new table 'repo_0_merge_rate' that has only repo_name having 0% merge_rate(repo_name), the number of pull requests(cnt_pr_id), the number of submitter(cnt_prs), the number of developer at that project(cnt_dev), the number of case where submitter and closer is same(s_c_same), and rate of the number of case where submitter and closer is same(s_c_rate).

 There is 65 projects out of 103 total projcets that have 100% s_c_rate.
That mean that pull_requset at over half projects having 0% merge rate is closed by submitterself. 
The projects has smaller number of developers less then 30, also tends to have small number of pull requests.
What is unique project is 'Clashnia/Minecraft-Demigods'. That has 151 pull request, but has only 2 developers, 0% merge rate and s_c_rate is 100%.
Actually I couldn't find out complete reasoon that they has that merge rate.
but the reason that over helf projcet having 0% merge rate have that merge rate is submitter closed their pull request themselves.

#15 What is the average time to merge a pull request per project?
#16 What is the average time to close a pull request per project?
average merge time : 7920.818 min
summary // min:0 / 1st Qu.: 17 / median : 260 / Mean :7021 / 3rd Qu.:2516 / Max.: 1328549 
It looks really werid. That summary said 75% pull request is merged within 3000 min(= 50 hour = about 2days)
So, The mean is 7021, but most of merged pull request is merged in much less time than the average.

average close time : 36343.93 min
summary // min:0 / lst Qu.:118 / median : 1605 / Mean : 36344 / 3rd Qu.: 16911 / Max. :1460121
As you can see in the summary report, we can find the close time is clearly longer than merge time.
But, When I looked the histogram of close time, most of closed pull request also is closed at short time.

I think the time will be shorter if submitter merged or closed the pull reqest themselves.
So I made that table (15-2 / 16-2)

(15-1 / 15-2)
first, at the case submitter merged the pull requests themselves, merge times tend to be shorter then merge times in all things. 
summary // min:0 /1st Qu. : 1 / Median :101 / Mean :4122 / 3rd Qu : 1678 / Max : 990538
The number of total pull request at this table is 31386. and the number of pull request having 0 merge time is 7075!
About 23% pull request in that table is merged within 1 min.
Then what about the case been reversed?
summary // min:0 / 1st Qu : 33 / Median : 364 / Mean : 8523 / 3rd Qu : 2780 / Max :1328549
Certainly, you can see that the time for merging by others in noticeably longer.


(16-1 / 16-2)
How about close time?
at the case submitter closed the pull requests themselves, we can get the result
summary // min :0 / 1st Qu: 26 / midian : 1010 / mean : 21760 / 3rd Qu: 7518 / Max : 1460121
and the reverse case.
summary // min :0 / 1st Qu: 304/ midian : 3072 / mean : 47214 / 3rd Qu : 28932 / Max : 1442847 
I think the close times that submitter closed themselves seem it doesn't make much difference.
but the reverse cases seem it takes longer time then close times of all data.


#18 #19 How many pull requests are submitted by each developer?(and merged)
summery about cnt_pr // min :1 / 1st Qu : 1 / Median : 2 / Mean :7 / 3rd Qu : 4 / Max : 384
It is really interesting. 
75% of the total developers submitted pull request just no more than 4 times.
About 90% of total developer submitted pull request just no more than 10 times.
Just 1.2% of total developer submitted pull request over than 100 times.

Summary about developers who submitted pull request over than 100 times.
min :0 / 1st Qu :82.03 / Median : 89.83 / Mean : 81.96 / 3rd Qu. 94.43 / Max :100 
Most of developers who submitted relatively many pull request have marge rate of 80 or more.

How about developer who submitted pull request no more than 100 times and over than 1
(I think developer who submitted one pull request has extreme value. so I ruled out the developers)
Summary about them
min :0 / 1st Qu 33.33 / Median :59.22 / Mean 56.30 / 3rd Qu : 90.48 / Max: 100

That result show that developers who submitted relatively many times tend to have high merge rate and developers who submitted relatively few tiems tend to have low merge rate.

How many pull requests is merged per developers?
Summary of the merge rate per developers
Min : 0 / 1st Qu : 0 / Median : 60 / Mean : 53.41 / 3rd Qu : 100 / Max : 100 
why each 25% of people in total has 0% merge rate or 100% merge rate?
I guess that many developers submitted very few pull reqests, As you can see the above result.
So I removed the people who submitted only one pull request.
the result is
min : 0 / 1st Qu : 33.33 / Median : 60 / Mean : 56.88 / 3rd Qu : 91.13  / Max : 100 
And How many people who submitted one pull request has 100 merge rate?
3848 developers get 100% merge rate. that mean 49% of developers who submitted one pull request get 100% merge rate.
and 51% of developers who submitted one pull request get 0% merge rate.

#20 How many developers work as submittes for each country?
there is 123 countries.
and summary of count is
Min : 1 / 1st Qu :3 / Median : 12 / Mean :141.1 / 3rd Qu.:66.5 / Max : 6621
