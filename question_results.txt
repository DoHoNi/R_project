#1 how many pull requests are available in the data for analysis? = 131191

#2 how many pull requests are submitted from each country?
There is 123 country where have nationalities of submitters.
summary count_pr -> min : 1.0/ 1st Qu : 8.0 / midian : 52.5 / Mean 1058 / 3rd Qu 448 / Max : 55633
The country that has the most submitted pull requsets is United states.The United states has 55633 pull request
The number of countries that has one submitted pull request are 12

#6 What is the overall pull rerquset acceptance rate for the sample of data?
summary merge_rate >> min :0 / 1st Qu : 46 / median :60 / mean : 56 / 3rd qu :71 / max :100
There are 6 countries that has 100% accept rate, and 13 countries that has 0% accept rate.

# why some country has 100% accept rate?
the country having 100% accept rate : Armenia(13) , Cuba(1), Cyprus(1),Martinique(1),Qatar(1),Rwanda(1)
the result -> 
Armenia : there is one developer, his all pull request marged by himself. 
Cuba : There is just one pull requset , but his pull requset is marged by American(8592).
Cyprus : There is just one pull requset, but his pull request is merged by Argentina(6616).
Martinique : There is just one pull request, but his pull requst is merged by Russia(4942).
Qatar : There is just one pull requst, but his pull request is merged by Italy(55945).
Rwanda : There is just one pull requset, but his pull requset is merged by American(71897).
	= The result show the reason for that question is that all of pull request from Armenia is merged by himself, there is only one pull requst from the rest of the country.


#why some country has 0% integration rate?
The number of countries where has 0% accept rate is closed is 13.
11 countries have fewer then 6 pull request, of which seven countries have one pull requset.
Virgin islands and Tunisia each have 12 and 13 pull request.
Virgin islands has only one develper.
6 out of the 13 his pull requsets were closed by the requesting himself.
One of them was closed by integrator from the United States who has 38.82% integration rate. [cnt_pr = 85]
Another was closed by integrator from the Australia who has 14.08% integration rate.[cnt_pr = 142]
The others was closed by integrator from the Australia who has 7.01% integration rate.[cnt_pr = 827] 
Tunisia has 4 developers.
What is interesting here is that all pull requests were closed by a Vietnamese, except for the pull	requests that was closed by themselves.
4 developers of Tunisia sent pull requests at same group 'exoplatform' even though the project names were differnt like exoplatfrom/platform , exoplatform/ecms.
The Vietnamese has 12.9 integration rate [cnt_pr = 93]

I try to find other factors like size of project, how many files have changed, but I didn't find any particular pattern. 
but, Integrtion rate of 0% mean no one has ever been merged. 
And the numbers 12 and 13 might be seem to be relatively high compared to countries with 0% integration rate, but it is not large in the overall data.
One of the factors I can guess is that they were inexperience submitter, and the countries was a unfamiliar country to integrator.

#3 How many pull requests are submitted to each project?
There is 999 projects.


#4 how many pull requests are reviewed by each developers?
This result is really strange.
Min = 1.00 / 1st Qu. = 1.00 / Median = 2.00/ Mean = 26.57 / 3rd Qu.=8.00 / Max = 39216.00
The interesting thing about this result is that 3047 reviewers out of 6419 reviewers have reviewed just once. 
The number of reviewers who reviewed pull requests up to 0.1% of total is 242.

#How many people who prs and prm are the same person and prs and prc are the same person are?
all pr = 131191 / prs=prm : 31386 / prs=prc : 48321 / prs=prc and merged :31673 / prs=prc and closed :16648
It mean prs=prm : 23.92% prs_prc : 36.83% -> merged :24.14 (65.55) , closed :12.69(34.45) 

#5 what is thae start and end dataes of activities in the dataset?
I had difficulty getting the first and last time of pull requests in the whole, so I serched differently according to each situation.
crated_at = 2010-08-31 12:19:21 / 2014-02-07 20:58:13
merged_at = 2011-03-17 06:26:10 / 2014-02-08 00:35:41
closed_at = 2011-03-17 04:14:05 / 2014-02-08 07:55:53
the first pull request  => create 2010-08-31 12:19:21
the last pull request  => close 2014-02-08 07:55:53

#6 what is the overall pull requset acceptance rate for the sample of data? = 70%

#7 How many pull requests are submitted per country? => The result is same as #2 question.

#8 How many pull requsets are evaluated per country? 

The most evaluated country is the United States (64641)
The second most evaluated country is the United Kingdom (14776)
